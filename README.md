## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- Stackoverflow for a randomly assigned array ("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3895478/does-javascript-have-a-method-like-range-to-generate-a-range-within-the-supp")
- Image resources button: https://www.pexels.com/photo/close-up-photograph-of-flowers-931177/, background: https://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/95/63/3kAJxo.jpg
- Background image for CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- When I wanted to set up the images on the gamebuttons, I actually wanted to make it brighter after clicking it. I realized that background set up was permanant for a button, and I know there would be a way to solve.
But I just went to more creative way that I can just show the image when they are clicked. It was much more efficient because I wouldn't need to look up all the images and still show the effects as I wanted. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- I was wondering how they can layout the whole web pages with various features. For me, the layout and alignment was the most difficult part. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- If I had more hours, I would add more features such as putting a timer on the top right after the play is over. So user can check up the timer while solving the problem. Or I want to add instuction page,
so anyone who plays this game for the first time, they can go read and play it.
